    <h2>What is biotechnology?</h2>
    <p><span class="intro">Biotechnology is a technological application where biological systems and living organisms or their derivatives are used to modify or improve them. It is becoming increasingly popular around the world and is being used more and more every day. </span></p>
    <h2>Biotechnology as a science</h2>
    <p><span class="intro">It was mainly known as "Ancient Biotechnology" in the 1800s. Discoveries were made based on observations of nature, in order to improve human life. At the end of that same year, "Classic Biotechnology" was developed, where the transfer of genetic information was discovered. This experiment is known as "The Laws of Inheritance" by Gregor Mendel, which was carried out with pea plants. Finally the "Modern Biotechnology" which is the one that is currently known, discoveries were made such as the structure of DNA and its role in inheritance.</span>
    <h2>Biotechnology Drugs</h2>
    <p><span class="intro">In the development of biotechnological drugs, the DNA of a living organism is modified, therefore, the body receives the substance it requires to correct any abnormality, without affecting other organs.</span></p>

    <p><span class="intro">An example of a drug developed with this science is human growth hormone, a naturally synthesized protein that has the function of stimulating growth.</span></p><br>
    <p><span class="intro">In conclusion, we can see the evolution of medicines and the ways in which they were developed. Biotechnological medicines were incorporated, which are more complex, more detailed and more specific. </span></p>
